## 0.5.0

### Breaking Changes

- Support for Qubit and Target Placeholdres have been added. Converting programs and instructions to a string has been removed and replaced with a fallible to_quil() method. The `Label` struct has been repurposed to support `Label` instructions specifically. The `Target` enum has been added to express `@targets` as part of an instruction. (#266)
- Decouple expression hashing and equality (#277)
